This project is an exercise in building our the back end of a politically-themed card game called 'Spin'.

'Spin' is a game for 2-6 players, each representing a political candidate in the run up to a general election. The aim of the game is to be the player with the highest total number of voters at the end of the final round. To help accomplish this goal, players can play various types of cards to attract voters, gain influence, and disrupt their opponents' plans.

The game is split into two distinct phases: The Draft phase and the Campaign phase. During the Draft phase, three randomly chosen cards are revealed, and each player takes turns selecting one card that they would like to add to their deck. Once a card is chosen, it is replaced by a new random card. The Draft phase is over once all of the cards are depleted, and each player has built their own personal deck using the cards that they have chosen.

The Campaign phase is where the bulk of the gameplay takes place. Players each draw a hand of five cards from their respective decks, and can then play up to three cards from their hand before drawing from their deck until they have five cards again. Then they pass the turn to the player on their left. At the start of the game there is a central pool of 'undecided' voters that players can sway to their side using card effects. Once this pool is depleted, players can steal voters directly from their opponents as the campaign race heats up. When the voter pool is empty, the player with the most voters at the start of their turn is considered to be in 'Pole Position'. If they can maintain this position until the start of their next turn (i.e. they still have the most voters), they win the game.
